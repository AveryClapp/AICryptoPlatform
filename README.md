The main goal of this project is to create a program that will allow for powerful insights into desired companies. By leveraging the use of Artificial Intelligence, the goal is to contextualize the actions of a company into a standardized "sentiment score" or something along those lines (TBD) in order to allow for smarter investing decisions.

Preliminary Thought Process:

User Runs the Program
Enter Email and Stock Ticker Symbol
Scrape recent price data and X most recent news articles around the website
Using python and some sort of AI integration contextualize the information surrounding this stock
Parse through information to create some sort of guidance on whether it is a good investment or not
Return data back to user
Long-Term Goals:

Allow for users to create accounts
Implement front and back end for website that will allow for easy use to program
API
More parameters and overall more accuracy with provided decision
