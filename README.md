# AIStockPicker
The main goal of this project is to create a program that will allow for powerful insights into desired companies. By leveraging the use of Artificial Intelligence, the goal is to contextualize the actions of a company into a standardized "sentiment score" or something along those lines (TBD) in order to allow for smarter investing decisions. 

Preliminary Thought Process:
1) User Runs the Program
2) Enter Email and Stock Ticker Symbol
3) Scrape recent price data and X most recent news articles around the website
4) Using python and some sort of AI integration contextualize the information surrounding this stock
5) Parse through information to create some sort of guidance on whether it is a good investment or not
6) Return data back to user

Long-Term Goals:
1) Allow for users to create accounts
2) Implement front and back end for website that will allow for easy use to program
3) API
4) More parameters and overall more accuracy with provided decision
